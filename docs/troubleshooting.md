# Troubleshooting

## Windows

- Try running Nyrna as administrator
- Check if the game uses [Easy Anti-Cheat](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Easy_Anti-Cheat) or similar
  software. If so, Nyrna may not work with it as these frameworks specifically
  block other software from interacting with the game.

### Specific applications

Shortcut doesn't work because the game grabs exclusive keyboard control. Use the
GUI method to toggle suspend/resume.
